    "# Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a movie recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations to users based on their ratings of other movies. The system will utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze user ratings and similarities between movies to generate a list of top 5 movie recommendations for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the age of streaming services and an abundance of movie alternatives, customers frequently face the issue of finding films that match their preferences. A movie recommendation system seeks to solve this problem by using user ratings to generate individualized movie recommendations. The target audience for this project are companies that provide movie streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Hulu, which can in turn use recommendation systems to increase their customer engagement and retention. These businesses can provide personalized movie suggestions that adapt to their audience's different preferences by employing innovative machine learning techniques and user data, resulting in growth and competitive advantage in the entertainment industry.

    "\n",
    "### Details on the data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie recommendation service. It contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are contained in the following files: **links.csv**, **movies.csv**, **ratings.csv** and **tags.csv**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv):** All ratings are contained in the file ratings.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "userId,movieId,rating,timestamp\n",
    "The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv):** All tags are contained in the file tags.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "userId,movieId,tag,timestamp\n",
    "The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "movieId,title,genres\n",
    "Movie titles are entered manually or imported from https://www.themoviedb.org/, and include the year of release in parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Links Data File Structure (links.csv):**Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file links.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "movieId,imdbId,tmdbId\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of columns\n",
    "**User Ids:** MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between ratings.csv and tags.csv (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Movie Ids:** Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. Movie ids are consistent between ratings.csv, tags.csv, movies.csv, and links.csv (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timestamps:** represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tags:** are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genres:** are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Action, Adventure, Animation, Children's, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Fantasy, Film-Noir, Horror, Musical, Mystery, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller, War, Western, (no genres listed)\n",
